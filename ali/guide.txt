Docker Compose + Django Project Guide

Docker Setup:
You have the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your system.

Run the project with Docker Compose:
To build and start all services in detached mode, run:
  docker-compose up -d --build

Database:
If you are using PostgreSQL:
  No migrations were run automatically.
  Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
  Update your .env with correct DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT.
  After the DB is ready, run:
    python manage.py migrate

If you are using Sqlite:
  The database file will be created automatically inside the project.

Activate your virtual environment:
Linux/macOS:
  source ./venv/bin/activate
Windows:
  .\venv\Scripts\activate

Create superuser:
  python manage.py createsuperuser

Run server:
you can run your app like normal way:
  python manage.py runserver
Or you can build the dockerfile:
  docker build -t <your-image-name> .
