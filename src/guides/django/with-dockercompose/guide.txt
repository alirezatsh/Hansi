Django Project Guide - PostgreSQL + docker compose + Dockerfile


Running the Project:
Your project is up. You can go to http://localhost:8000 to see it.
Note: Migrations have already been run inside the container and the superuser has been created, so you donâ€™t need to run them again.

Database:
- To access the database and view tables inside the container:
    docker exec -it <dbname-container> psql -U <DB_USER> -d <DB_NAME>
- Once inside, use \dt to list all tables.

Virtual Environment:
- A virtual environment was used for initial project setup, but it is not needed now since everything runs inside the container.

Viewing Server Logs:
- To see Django server logs inside the container:
    docker logs -f <app-container-name>

Summary:
1. The project is running with Docker Compose.
2. Migrations have been applied inside the container.
3. Superuser was created inside the container.
4. No need for local virtual environment.
5. Logs and database can be accessed easily using Docker commands.
