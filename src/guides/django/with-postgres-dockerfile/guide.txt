Django Project Guide - PostgreSQL + Dockerfile

Database:
You selected PostgreSQL.
No migrations have been run automatically.
No superuser has been created.

1. Update your .env file with your local database settings:
   DB_NAME=<YOUR_DB_NAME>
   DB_USER=<YOUR_DB_USER>
   DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
   DB_HOST=<YOUR_DB_HOST>
   DB_PORT=<YOUR_DB_PORT>

2. Build Docker image:
   docker build -t <PROJECT_NAME>:latest .

3. Run a container interactively to perform migrations and create superuser:
   docker run -itd \
     -e DB_NAME=<YOUR_DB_NAME> \
     -e DB_USER=<YOUR_DB_USER> \
     -e DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD> \
     -e DB_HOST=<YOUR_DB_HOST> \
     -e DB_PORT=<YOUR_DB_PORT> \
     <PROJECT_NAME>:latest

4. Inside the container, run migrations:
   python manage.py migrate

5. Create Django superuser:
   python manage.py createsuperuser

Create Django App:
You should create the app inside the container. Every app you create will be mounted to the project. Use the following command:
    docker exec -it <appname-container> python manage.py startapp <appname>

After that, Your project is up. You can go to http://localhost:8000 to see it.
