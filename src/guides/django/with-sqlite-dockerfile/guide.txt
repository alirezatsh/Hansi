Django Project Guide - SQLite with Docker

Database:
You selected SQLite.
The database file will be created automatically inside the project.
The migrations were run automatically.
A Docker container has been created and is running your Django project.

Your project is up. You can go to http://localhost:8000 to see it.


No need to run the server manually.
Create superuser inside the container if needed:
  docker exec -it <project_name> python manage.py createsuperuser
